# Toronto-Climate-Data

## Business Scenario

### We are going to process Canadian Climate data.

Usually, when we want to download the weather data manually, we go to https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html.

But this time, you are going to use a data engineer way to download some data from Canada Climate website, and output one file.
